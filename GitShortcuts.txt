To clone a private repo:
git clone https://username@github.com/username/reponame.git

Add github repo:
git remote add origin <github url>

git add --all
Adds all new files you made to git in order to be commited (see below)

git commit -a -m "Commit message"
This commits changes (saves changes to git (not github, to do that see git push))
-a automatically stages files (honestly idk what this does but if it's not broke don't fix it)
-m lets you add the commit message

git push
Pushes local code to github
(if you are on a branch that isn't in github it will save that branch to github)

git push origin <branch-name>
Pushes code on your machine to the specified branch in github

git branch
Shows branches

git switch <branch-name>
Switches to a different branch

git checkout <branch-name>
Switches to a different branch

git switch -c <new-branch-name>

git branch -d <branch-name>
Deletes the branch from local machine (use -D if there are unsaved changes)

git push origin --delete <branch-to-delete>
Deletes the branch from github

git merge <branch-name>
Loads code from branch into your local code

git fetch origin <branch-name>
Fetches the latest changes from github and displays them for you to check

git log origin/<branch-name>

git pull
Incorporates changes from the current branch that aren't in your local code (if local code is behind github code then update code on this machine)

git pull origin <branch-name>
Incorporates changes from the branch that aren't in your local code (if local code is behind github code then update code on this machine)
